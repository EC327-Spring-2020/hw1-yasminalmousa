mov R1, 25 ;R1 contains 25
mov R2, 3 ;R2 contains 3
mov [R1], R2 ;store the content of R2 at the address stored in R1 - after this instruction, memory cell 25 contains 3
mov R3, R2 ;store the content of R2 (which is 3) into register R3 which is where we will be conducting the 'multiplication'
add R3, R2 ;adds the content of R2 (which is 3) to R3 (which is 3), produces a result of multiplying the content of R2 by 2 and storing it in R3
add R3, R2 ;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 3 and storing in R3)
add R3, R2 ;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 4 and storing in R3)
add R3, R2 ;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 5 and storing in R3)
add R3, R2 ;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 6 and storing in R3)
