32		mov R2, 3 	;R2 contains 3
33		mov [R1], R2 	;store the content of R2 at the address stored in R1 - after this instruction, memory cell 25 contains 3
34		mov R3, R2 	;store the content of R2 (which is 3) into register R3 which is where we will be conducting the          'multiplication'
35		add R3, R2 	;adds the content of R2 (which is 3) to R3 (which is 3), produces a result of multiplying the content of R2 by 2 and storing it in 				R3
36		add R3, R2 	;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 3 and storing in R3)
37		add R3, R2 	;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 4 and storing in R3)
38		add R3, R2 	;adds the content of R2 to R3 (multiplying the content of R2 by 5 and storing in R3)
